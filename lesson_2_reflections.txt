What happens when you inititalize a repository? Why do you need to it?

A hidden folder called .git is created in the directory you initialized.  You need this folder because it contains git's internal structure which it uses to track your commits and history.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The working area is not in the repository, so there is no tracking of the files done by git.  The staging area allows you to start tracking files via commits.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Each file in the stagin area can represent the logical change.
