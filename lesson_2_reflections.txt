What happens when you inititalize a repository? Why do you need to it?

A hidden folder called .git is created in the directory you initialized.  You need this folder because it contains git's internal structure which it uses to track your commits and history.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The working area is not in the repository, so there is no tracking of the files done by git.  The staging area allows you to start tracking files via commits.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Each file in the stagin area can represent the logical change.

What are some situations where branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Branches help if you want to experiment with new features, or maybe try architecting things differently than you had before.  This allows you evaluate it without making changes to your master, so that you can continue to develop master.
